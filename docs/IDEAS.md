# Ideas

## Reproducible Build

The same set of source code (including the lockfile), compiler parameters, toolchain version, and target platform should always result in the exact same set of output files.

## Compile-time Parameters for Whole Project or Library

Some projects and libraries would like to produce different outputs (e.g. different programs) based on different parametric configurations or compiler environments. However, allowing them to access the system directly from the source code would violate both the security sandbox and [reproducibility guarantee](#reproducible-build). Therefore, they may be accessed indirectly via either the compiler's CLI arguments or configuration files.

If a dependency requires compile-time parameters, they must be passed down from its dependant via the manifest file. The compile-time parameters shall be part of the identity of the dependency, similar to how generic works.

Compile-time parameters in the source tree may accept variables and expressions. The variables are the compile-time parameters. This would allow one to pass parameters from the CLI all the way down to indirect dependency should the configuration of the dependency chain allows it.

To allow the language server to work correctly without having to specify compile-time parameters, the types of compile-time parameters must always be declared at part of the source tree such as configuration files, source files, etc. If the compile-time parameters are set in the source tree, their types may be omitted.

Compile-time parameters set in the source tree are only default values. For a project, they can be overridden by compiler's CLI arguments. For a dependency, they can be overridden by having the dependant passing different values than the default.

Initially, the types of the compile-time parameters must be built-in primitives. More thought and design is required for the use of ecosystem types (custom types defined by users via library code).

### Compile-time Environment Variables

Compile-time Environment Variables are just string typed compile-time parameters. Nothing is special about them.

## Type-level Certifications

### Domains

Verifier functions may assign bounds to their return values. For example, a non-zero verifier will assign a `(!= 0)` certificate to its returning number.

~~One domain may be a subset of another. For example, `(> 3)` is a subset of `(> 2)`. Therefore, a `(> 3)` domain should imply `(> 2)`.~~

~~One domain may intersect with another. For example, `(> 3)` and `(< 5)` intersects at `(> 3) and (< 5)`.~~

Combining two domains with no intersection should result in a `never` type. For example, `(!= 0) and (== 0)` should collapse into `never`.

### Nominal certifications

Verifier functions may assign certificates to their return values. For example, UTF-8 verifier will assign a `utf8` certificate to its returning byte stream.

## Subtypes

A subtype `B` of `A` is just `A` but with potentially fewer variants.

A value of type `A` is incompatible with `B` but a value of type `B` is compatible with `A`.

If the inner of `B` does not have any special requirements than that of `A` (such as subtyped struct fields, narrower sum type, or type-level certifications), a value of type `A` can be explicitly cast into type `B`.

A subtype can inherit from multiple subtypes of the same origin type. For example, if `B1` and `B2` are both subtypes of `A`, then it is possible to declare a `C` that subtypes both `B1` and `B2`.

A subtype must have the same size as the base type. Thus, the subtyping mechanism does not permit OOP-style inheritance.

If the base type is a struct, the subtype can be a struct with stricter fields (i.e. fields whose types are subtypes of the fields in the base type). If the base type is a sum type, the subtype can include fewer variants than and from the base type, and/or can have stricter variant value types.

Orphan rule: If at least one of the direct or indirect base types is foreign, a foreign trait cannot be implemented on the subtype.

## Embedded text verifier

Verify embedded string literal at type-checker level. For example, verifying embedded JavaScript code to have correct syntax.

### Multi-line string

Multi-line string shares the same syntax as embedded text verifier, but with text verifier being no-op.

User may optionally specifies newline type (LF or CRLF). By default, the newline would be whatever the file uses.

## Macros

Macros don't merely process AST.

### Procedural macros

Const functions from an imported module can be used as a macro as long as the signature fits.

Functions tagged with the `meta` keyword may be used as a macro and should be type-checked before non-`meta` entities.

### Declarative macros

Declarative macros are declared with the `macro` keyword. All identifiers within the body of a declarative macro shall be resolved to their canonical paths, as a consequence:
* Declarative macros are bound to a scope.
* Declarative macros are incapable of referencing identifiers that don't exist.

**Differences from Rust:** In Rust, identifiers within a macro are only resolved after the macro expands, which means that identifiers within the macro will refer to whatever inside the module scope which the macro expands in. As a consequence, macro library authors are often forced to write canonical path (e.g. `::core::convert::Into::into()` instead of just `.into()`).

### Macro composition

Macros may be created by composing multiple macros.

### Eager type-checking in macros

Well-typed tokens inside macro body may be checked for type correctness before it was realized.

Macro applications with well-typed return type may be checked for type correctness without expanding the AST.

## First-Class Entities

### First-Class Functions

* A function is also a value.

### First-Class Types

* A concrete type is a value.
* A generic type is a type constructor.
* A type constructor is a const function that return a concrete type.

### First-Class Kinds

* A kind of a type or a kind is also a type.

### First-Class Traits

* A trait is a const function that returns a "trait bound" (also known as "constraint").
* The parameters of a trait can be any const value, including: primitives, types, kinds, traits, etc.

### First-Class Modules

* A concrete module is a value.
* A parameterized module is a function that return a concrete module.

## Trait Instance Targets

* Concrete types.
* Type constructors.

## Trait bounds

### Implied trait bounds

If trait bound `Foo(...)` implies trait bound `Bar(...)`,
1. Expression `Foo(...)` is equivalent to expression `Foo(...) and Bar(...)`.
2. Constraint `Foo(...)` is a subset of constraint `Bar(...)`.
3. When one writes the expression `Foo(...) and Bar(...)`, the linter may warn of unnecessary trait bound in `Bar(...)`.

Some traits may imply another trait (for example: `Convert(A, B)` implies `TryConvert(A, B, never)`), but a blanket instance would take away the ability to customize them. Therefore, trait instance writer should still explicitly specify the implied trait instance.

Some types may also imply a trait (for example: `HashMap(K, V)` implies `Hash(K)` and `Eq(K)`).

~~Implied trait bounds may be syntactically omitted when writing trait instances for generic types.~~

Both adding and removing implied trait bounds are backward incompatible change (semver major).

### Trait bounds by necessity

Unlike implied trait bounds where one trait bound is a subset of another, trait bounds by necessity are only required because of implementation requirements. For example, a generic struct may require a trait bound because one of its internal field has a type that has trait bounds.

Even if trait bound `Foo(...)` requires trait bound `Bar(...)` by necessity, `Foo(...)` does not imply `Bar(...)`. Therefore, in a generic declaration, adding `Foo(...)` does not provide the capabilities of `Bar(...)`.

The linter may warn of unused trait bounds by necessity if their presence are found to be unnecessary.

Adding trait bounds by necessity is a backward incompatible change (semver major), but removing them is backward compatible (semver minor).

## Variances of generic type parameters

Generic types are _invariant_ by default.

~~_Covariance_ and _contravariance_ can be expressed by higher order generic type parameters (types of types) with trait bounds related to subtyping.~~

(Can it really be expressed this way?)

## WASM-based plugins

> [!WARNING]
> Beware of [non-determinism](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/main/Nondeterminism.md). The non-deterministic behavior are to be disabled by default for plugins that may affect reproducibility. Plugins that require non-deterministic capabilities must request permission and should guarantee that the end result is unaffected by non-determinism. The end-user will assume that all plugins are deterministic regardless of whether they make use of non-deterministic capabilities. Failure of a plugin to guarantee determinism of its result is considered a bug of the plugin.

### WASM-based type constructors

Type constructors may be a WASM module.

### WASM-based const functions

Const functions may be a WASM module.

### WASM-based macros

Macros may be a WASM module.

## LEAN-like proofs (optional)

**Potential applications:**
* Statically-checked pre- and post-assertions.
* Subtyping.
* Branch narrowing.

**Observed properties:**
* Propositions are just types. Proven propositions resolve to "true". Disproven propositions resolve to "false". Unproven propositions are unresolved.
* "For All" and "Exists" look like closures/templates. They could be implemented as wrapper of closures or templates. For example (non-final): `ForAll((x: nat) => GreaterThanOrEqual(x, 0))`, `Exists((a: nat, b: nat) => Equal(a * b, 12))`.
